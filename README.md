MoleculeViewer
==============

A demo app showing a complex project (a la real world) built with a clean structure, divided responsobilities and MVC design pattern in mind.
It's a viewer/builder for simple 3d molecules with its own 3d scene, gui, the ability to load/save models and to show infos in a floating layer.

(Almost) every subpatch is documented. 
Docs are still in progress.
